Doesn't work. Will need to create a new one.

Commands used:
```
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
```

Also created the following files:
```
.babelrc
webpack.config.js
src/index.html
src/index.js
```
